Primary repo\+: \href{https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/WAVM}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Andrew\+Scheidecker/\+W\+A\+VM}

\section*{Overview}

This is a standalone VM for Web\+Assembly. It can load both the standard binary format, and the text format defined by the \href{https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/ml-proto}{\tt Web\+Assembly reference interpreter}. For the text format, it can load both the standard stack machine syntax and the old-\/fashioned A\+ST syntax used by the reference interpreter, and all of the testing commands.

\section*{Building and running it}

To build it, you\textquotesingle{}ll need C\+Make and \href{http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#4.0.0}{\tt L\+L\+VM 4.\+0}. If C\+Make can\textquotesingle{}t find your L\+L\+VM directory, you can manually give it the location in the L\+L\+V\+M\+\_\+\+D\+IR C\+Make configuration variable. Note that on Windows, you must compile L\+L\+VM from source, and manually point the L\+L\+V\+M\+\_\+\+D\+IR configuration variable at {\ttfamily $<$L\+L\+VM build directory$>$\textbackslash{}lib\textbackslash{}cmake\textbackslash{}llvm}.

\subsubsection*{Building W\+A\+VM on Windows}

{\bfseries 1.) Install the \href{http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools}{\tt Visual Studio C++ Build Tools for Visual Studio 2015 or 2017}}

Take note of which version you have installed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If using Visual Studio 2015, use {\ttfamily -\/G\char`\"{}\+Visual Studio 14 Win64\char`\"{}} for the {\ttfamily $<$VS Generator Directive$>$} placeholder below
\item If using Visual Studio 2017, use {\ttfamily -\/G\char`\"{}\+Visual Studio 15 Win64\char`\"{}} for the {\ttfamily $<$VS Generator Directive$>$} placeholder below
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries 2.) Build L\+L\+VM x64 on Windows with Visual Studio}

Create an llvm\+\_\+build directory, navigate to that directory and run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -Thost=x64 <VS Generator Directive> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<desired install path for LLVM> <path to LLVM source>
\end{DoxyVerb}


Open the generated L\+L\+V\+M.\+sln locateed within the \textquotesingle{}llvm\+\_\+build\textquotesingle{} directory in Visual Studio and build the \char`\"{}\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\char`\"{} Project

The output binaries should be located in {\ttfamily $<$desired install path for L\+L\+VM$>$}

{\bfseries 3.) Build W\+A\+VM x64 on Windows with Visual Studio against L\+L\+VM x64}

Create a wavm\+\_\+build directory, navigate to that directory and run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -Thost=x64 <VS Generator Directive> -DLLVM_DIR=<LLVM build directory>\lib\cmake\llvm <path to WAVM source>
\end{DoxyVerb}


Open the generated W\+A\+V\+M.\+sln located within the \textquotesingle{}wavm\+\_\+build\textquotesingle{} directory in Visual Studio and build the \char`\"{}\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\char`\"{} Project

The output binaries should be located in {\ttfamily wavm\+\_\+build\textbackslash{}bin}

\section*{Usage}

I\textquotesingle{}ve tested it on Windows with Visual C++ 2015/2017, Linux with G\+CC and clang, and Mac\+OS with Xcode/clang. Travis CI is testing Linux/\+G\+CC, Linux/clang, and O\+S\+X/clang.

The primary executable is {\ttfamily wavm}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
Usage: wavm [switches] [programfile] [--] [arguments]
  in.wast|in.wasm       Specify program file (.wast/.wasm)
  -f|--function name        Specify function name to run in module rather than main
  -c|--check            Exit after checking that the program is valid
  -d|--debug            Write additional debug information to stdout
  --                Stop parsing arguments
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily wavm} will load a Web\+Assembly file and call {\ttfamily main} (or a specified function). Example programs to try without changing any code include those found in the Test/wast and Test/spec directory such as the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
wavm Test/wast/helloworld.wast
wavm Test/Benchmark/Benchmark.wast
wavm Test/zlib/zlib.wast
\end{DoxyCode}


Web\+Assembly programs that export a main function with the standard parameters will be passed in the command line arguments. If the same main function returns a i32 type it will become the exit code. W\+A\+VM supports Emscripten\textquotesingle{}s defined I/O functions so programs can read from stdin and write to stdout and stderr. See \href{Test/wast/echo.wast}{\tt echo.\+wast} for an example of a program that echos the command line arguments back out through stdout.

There are a few additional executables that can be used to assemble the W\+A\+ST file into a binary\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Assemble in.wast out.wasm
\end{DoxyCode}


Disassemble a binary into a W\+A\+ST file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Disassemble in.wasm out.wast
\end{DoxyCode}


and to execute a test script defined by a W\+A\+ST file (see the \href{Test/spec}{\tt Test/spec directory} for examples of the syntax)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Test in.wast
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Architecture}

\subsection*{IR}

The \href{Include/IR}{\tt IR} (Intermediate Representation) is the glue that the W\+A\+ST parser, the W\+A\+SM serialization, and the Runtime communicate through. It closely mirrors the semantics of the Web\+Assembly binary format, but is easier to work with in memory.

\subsection*{Parsing}

Parsing the Web\+Assembly text format uses a table-\/driven deterministic finite automaton to scan the input string for tokens. The tables are generated from a set of tokens that match literal strings, and a set of tokens that match regular expressions. The parser is a standard recursive descent parser.

\subsection*{Runtime}

The \href{Source/Runtime/}{\tt Runtime} is the primary consumer of the byte code. It provides an \href{Include/Runtime/Runtime.h}{\tt A\+PI} for instantiating Web\+Assembly modules and calling functions exported from them. To instantiate a module, it \href{Source/Runtime/ModuleInstance.cpp}{\tt initializes the module\textquotesingle{}s runtime environment} (globals, memory objects, and table objects), \href{Source/Runtime/LLVMEmitIR.cpp}{\tt translates the byte code into L\+L\+VM IR}, and \href{Source/Runtime/LLVMJIT.cpp}{\tt uses L\+L\+VM to generate machine code} for the module\textquotesingle{}s functions.
