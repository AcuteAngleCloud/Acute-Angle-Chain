This contract implements a simple D\+I\+CE game between two players with 50/50 odds of winning.

Before playing all players deposit funds into their  account just like the  contract


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Player 1 proposes to bet 1 A\+AC and submits S\+H\+A256(secret1)
\item Player 2 proposes to bet 1 A\+AC and submits S\+H\+A256(secret2)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Because Player 1 and 2 bet equal amounts their orders are matched and the game begins.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} Player reveales their secret
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} 5 minute deadline starts whereby the first to reveal automatically wins unless the other player reveals
\item The other player reveals and a winner is chosen and paid based upon the value of \mbox{\hyperlink{structsha256}{sha256( cat(secret1,secret2) )}}
\item After the deadline anyone can trigger a default claim and the rewards
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Economic Incentive for Interface Developers }

\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} variation on this game would be to add an additional information on offer creation that will get paid a commission when the player wins. With this commission in place there is financial incentive for a service provider to continue to execute the game in a timely manner as well as provide quality and entertaining interfaces on top of this game.

\subsection*{Other Games }

This same basic model can be used to build more robust games.

\subsection*{Potential Vulnerabilities }


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Block Producers may exclude reveal transaction
\item Losers may force winner to wait 5 minutes to get rewards
\item Service providers may fail to auto-\/reveal on your behalf
\item You may lose internet connectivity mid-\/game
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} blockhain reorganization could cause some havock if secrets are revealed too quickly
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item could protect users by rejecting reveals until a game creation is irreversible (about 45 seconds max)
\item users could take risk themselves by deciding how many confirmations are required
\item for small amounts it probably doesn\textquotesingle{}t matter
\item under normal operation of D\+P\+OS chains there are few if any chain reorganizations 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
