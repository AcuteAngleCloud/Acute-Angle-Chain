Web\+Socket++ is a header only library. You can start using it by including the websocketpp source directory in your project\textquotesingle{}s include path and including the appropriate Web\+Socket++ headers in your program. You may also need to include and/or link to appropriate Boost/system libraries. T\+O\+DO\+: More information\+: Building a program with Web\+Socket++, Walkthroughs of the example programs

Web\+Socket++ includes cmake and scons scripts for building the examples and unit tests. Neither system is needed unless you want to build tests or examples in an automated fashion.
