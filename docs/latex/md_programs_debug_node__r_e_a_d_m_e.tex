The {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+node} is a tool to allow developers to run many interesting sorts of \char`\"{}what-\/if\char`\"{} tests using state from a production blockchain. Like \char`\"{}what happens if I produce enough blocks for the next hardfork time to arrive?\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}what would happen if this account (which I don\textquotesingle{}t have a private key for) did this transaction?\char`\"{}

\subsection*{Setup }

Be sure you\textquotesingle{}ve built the right build targets\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make get_dev_key debug_node cli_wallet witness_node
\end{DoxyVerb}


Use the {\ttfamily get\+\_\+dev\+\_\+key} utility to generate a keypair\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ programs/genesis_util/get_dev_key "" nathan
[{"private_key":"5Jgm1N6jp3iNbFM45kPtj66xmbqT9fSuVJgPWfnCSPgQanvW6mJ","public_key":"BTS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV","address":"BTSFAbAx7yuxt725qSZvfwWqkdCwp9ZnUama"}]
\end{DoxyVerb}


Obtain a copy of the blockchain in {\ttfamily block\+\_\+db} directory\+: \$ programs/witness\+\_\+node/witness\+\_\+node --data-\/dir data/mydatadir \section*{... wait for chain to sync}

$^\wedge$C \$ cp -\/\+Rp data/mydatadir/blockchain/database/block\+\_\+num\+\_\+to\+\_\+block ./block\+\_\+db

Set up a new datadir with the following {\ttfamily config.\+ini} settings\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# setup API endpoint
rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090
# setting this to empty effectively disables the p2p network
seed-nodes = []
# set apiaccess.json so we can set up
api-access = "data/debug_datadir/api-access.json"
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then set up {\ttfamily data/debug\+\_\+datadir/api-\/access.\+json} to allow access to the debug A\+PI like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}{
   "permission_map" :
   [
      [
         "bytemaster",
         {
            "password_hash_b64" : "9e9GF7ooXVb9k4BoSfNIPTelXeGOZ5DrgOYMj94elaY=",
            "password_salt_b64" : "INDdM6iCi/8=",
            "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api", "network_node_api", "debug_api"]
         }
      ],
      [
         "*",
         {
            "password_hash_b64" : "*",
            "password_salt_b64" : "*",
            "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api"]
         }
      ]
   ]
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


See \href{https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene#accessing-restricted-apis}{\tt here} for more detail on the {\ttfamily api-\/access.\+json} format.

Once that is set up, run {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+node} against your newly prepared datadir\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}programs/debug_node/debug_node --data-dir data/debug_datadir
\end{DoxyVerb}


Run {\ttfamily cli\+\_\+wallet} to connect to the {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+node} port, using the username and password to access the new {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+api} (and also a different wallet file)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s 127.0.0.1:8090 -w debug.wallet -u bytemaster -p supersecret
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Example usage }

Load some blocks from the datadir\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}dbg_push_blocks block_db 20000
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note, when pushing a very large number of blocks sometimes {\ttfamily cli\+\_\+wallet} hangs and you must Ctrl+C and restart it (leaving the {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+node} running).

Generate (fake) blocks with our own private key\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}dbg_generate_blocks 5Jgm1N6jp3iNbFM45kPtj66xmbqT9fSuVJgPWfnCSPgQanvW6mJ 1000
\end{DoxyVerb}


Update {\ttfamily angel} account to be controlled by our own private key and generate a (fake) transfer\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}dbg_update_object {"_action":"update", "id":"1.2.1090", "active":{"weight_threshold":1,"key_auths":[["BTS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV",1]]}}
import_key angel 5Jgm1N6jp3iNbFM45kPtj66xmbqT9fSuVJgPWfnCSPgQanvW6mJ
transfer angel init0 999999 BTS "" true
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{How it works }

The commands work by creating diff(s) from the main chain that are applied to the local chain at specified block height(s). It lets you easily check out \char`\"{}what-\/if\char`\"{} scenarios in a fantasy debug toy world forked from the real chain, e.\+g. \char`\"{}if we take all of the blocks until today, then generate a bunch more until a hardfork time
in the future arrives, does the chain stay up?  Can I do transactions X, Y, and Z in the wallet after the hardfork?\char`\"{} Anyone connecting to this node sees the same fantasy world, so you can e.\+g. make changes with the {\ttfamily cli\+\_\+wallet} and see them exist in other {\ttfamily cli\+\_\+wallet} instances (or G\+UI wallets or A\+PI scripts).

\subsection*{Limitations }

The main limitations are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item No export format for the diffs, so you can\textquotesingle{}t really \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} connect multiple {\ttfamily debug\+\_\+node} to each other.
\item Once faked block(s) or tx(s) have been produced on your chain, you can\textquotesingle{}t really \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} stream blocks or tx\textquotesingle{}s from the main network to your chain.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{[}1\mbox{]} It should theoretically be possible, but it\textquotesingle{}s non-\/trivial and totally untested.
