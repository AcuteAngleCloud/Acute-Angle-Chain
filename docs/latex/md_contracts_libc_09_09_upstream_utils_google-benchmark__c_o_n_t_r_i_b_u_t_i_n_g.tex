\item If you are an individual writing original source code and you\textquotesingle{}re sure you own the intellectual property, then you\textquotesingle{}ll need to sign an \mbox{[}individual C\+LA\mbox{]}\mbox{[}\mbox{]}.
\item If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you\textquotesingle{}ll need to sign a \href{https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate}{\tt corporate C\+LA}.

You generally only need to submit a C\+LA once, so if you\textquotesingle{}ve already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don\textquotesingle{}t need to do it again.

Once your C\+LA is submitted (or if you already submitted one for another Google project), make a commit adding yourself to the \mbox{[}A\+U\+T\+H\+O\+RS\mbox{]}\mbox{[}\mbox{]} and \mbox{[}C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+I\+B\+U\+T\+O\+RS\mbox{]}\mbox{[}\mbox{]} files.

\subsection*{Submitting a patch}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you\textquotesingle{}re intending to fix. Even if you think it\textquotesingle{}s relatively minor, it\textquotesingle{}s helpful to know what people are working on. Mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be assigned to you.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Follow the normal process of \href{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo}{\tt forking} the project, and setup a new branch to work in. It\textquotesingle{}s important that each group of changes be done in separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits related to that bug or feature.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Do your best to have \href{http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html}{\tt well-\/formed commit messages} for each change. This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a \href{https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request}{\tt pull request}.
