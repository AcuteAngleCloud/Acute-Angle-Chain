\subsection{Detailed Description}
The block\+\_\+summary defines the set of transactions that were successfully applied as they are organized into cycles and shards. \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} shard contains the set of transactions I\+Ds which are either user generated transactions or code-\/generated transactions.

The primary purpose of a block is to define the order in which messages are processed.

The secodnary purpose of a block is certify that the messages are valid according to a group of 3rd party validators (producers).

The next purpose of a block is to enable light-\/weight proofs that a transaction occured and was considered valid.

The next purpose is to enable code to generate messages that are certified by the producers to be authorized.

\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} block is therefore defined by the ordered set of executed and generated transactions, and the merkle proof is over set of messages delivered as a result of executing the transactions.

\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} message is defined by \{ receiver, code, function, permission, data \}, the merkle tree of a block should be generated over a set of message I\+Ds rather than a set of transaction ids. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
