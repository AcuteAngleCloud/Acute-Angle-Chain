A\+A\+C\+IO supports two different elliptic curves for E\+C\+D\+SA -- secp256k1 and secp256r1 (also called prime256v1). The benefit of the r1 curve is hardware support in many mobile devices such as i\+Phones or Android devices. This application demonstrates usage of the r1 curve in a hardware device via the Secure Enclave on recent Mac\+Book Pros with the Touch \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_bar}{Bar}}. An r1 private key is stored on the Secure Enclave and is not visible to the host. This private key can then be used to sign S\+H\+A256 digests (which could be the hash of an A\+A\+C\+IO transaction) via the Secure Enclave. For verification of proper operation, the application then allows verification of public key recovery in the A\+A\+C\+IO code base.

\section*{Building and Signing}

The application {\ttfamily applesedemo} will be built on mac\+OS builds of the A\+A\+C\+IO source tree. The A\+P\+Is in use require mac\+OS 10.\+12+ (and ought to function on i\+O\+S10+ as well). However, usage of the Secure Enclave requires that the application be signed with a Mac App Store (M\+AS) style signature -- older Darwin style signatures are not sufficient. This strong signature requirement ensures that the application which generated a particular private key is the only application that can use the private key.

Signing {\ttfamily applesedemo} as a M\+AS style application is clumsy in our case for two reasons; 1) these signatures require packaging in an \char`\"{}app bundle\char`\"{} which doesn\textquotesingle{}t fit well for command line applications, and 2) the desire to keep all build steps devoid of X\+Code usage.

The script {\ttfamily sign.\+sh} is included which generates an app bundle {\ttfamily applesedemo.\+app} and signs it. It must be run with the unsigned {\ttfamily applesedemo} in its current working directory. \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_three}{Three}} parameters are required\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The S\+H\+A1 thumbprint of the signing certificate to use
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The fully formed App\+ID of the signed application (team\+ID + bundle\+ID)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Path to the provisioning profile used for signing
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

There is a commented out example in the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt which shows how the script can be executed post-\/build automatically.

Once signed, you must execute the {\ttfamily applesedemo} that is bundled inside the app build, i.\+e. {\ttfamily applesedemo.\+app/\+Contents/\+Mac\+O\+S/applesedemo}. There is a crude check to print an error if attempting to execute an unsigned {\ttfamily applesedemo} but it may not catch cases of an application that is invalidly signed. An application that is invalidly signed and attempts to use the Secure Enclave can experience some unhelpful error messages.

\subsection*{Personal Signing}

If you have access to the Apple Developer Program it is possible to use the developer portal to download a provisioning profile and/or create a developer certificate if you do not already have one.

However, even without a Developer account it\textquotesingle{}s possible to use any Apple ID to generate a development certificate and provisioning profile that can be used locally. Unfortunately, this process has to be done via X\+Code\textquotesingle{}s automatic \char`\"{}managed\char`\"{} signing mechanism. You must create a new Cocoa App in X\+Code, assign a pertinent bundle identifier, and then select your \char`\"{}\+Personal Team\char`\"{} for the Team to use. X\+Code will then contact Apple\textquotesingle{}s servers and generate a proper provisioning profile and certificate if you do not already have one. You may have to manually look at the profiles created in {\ttfamily $\sim$/\+Library/\+Mobile\+Device/\+Provisioning\textbackslash{} Profiles/} to find the proper one to use.

Remember that the Team\+ID plus the Bundle ID that you fill out in X\+Code gate access to the Secure Enclave. Changing either of these values will cause the application to be unable to see keys generated with previous values.

\section*{Usage}

\subsection*{Generate Private \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_key}{Key}}}

First, create a private key inside of the secure enclave. This application supports creating the key in a few different manners (see {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}) that control the level of security the key is protected with. In this example, the key will be created in a way that requires usage of a fingerprint when signing a digest (such a signing a transaction). 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ applesedemo.app/Contents/MacOS/applesedemo --create-se-touch-only
Successfully created
public\_key(AACR17iKCZrb1JqSjUncCbDGQenzSqyuNmPU8iUA15efNW5KD1iHd9x)
\end{DoxyCode}
 The public key for the private key is printed; note it somewhere. It is possible to ask the Secure Enclave to create multiple private keys and assign labels to them but this application only allows a single key at once. \subsection*{Create \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_a}{A}} Digest and Sign It}

A\+A\+C\+IO uses S\+H\+A256 digests to sign transactions, create a simple S\+H\+A256 digest from a small string\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ echo 'Hello world!' | shasum -a 256
0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8  -
\end{DoxyCode}
 Now, ask the Secure Enclave to sign the digest with the private key only it knows about. The signature will not be generated until a valid fingerprint is used. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ applesedemo.app/Contents/MacOS/applesedemo --sign
       0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8

      signature(AACR1Jx4sBidhFV6PSvS8hWbG5oh77HKud8xpkoHLvWaZVaBeWttRpyEjaGbPRVEKu3JePTyVjANmP4GKFtG2DAuB4MTVqsdC9W)
\end{DoxyCode}
 \subsection*{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_key}{Key}} Recovery}

Given the signature and digest, we must be able to correlate that with the public key that signed the digest. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ applesedemo.app/Contents/MacOS/applesedemo --recover
       0ba904eae8773b70c75333db4de2f3ac45a8ad4ddba1b242f0b3cfc199391dd8 \(\backslash\)
     AACR1Jx4sBidhFV6PSvS8hWbG5oh77HKud8xpkoHLvWaZVaBeWttRpyEjaGbPRVEKu3JePTyVjANmP4GKFtG2DAuB4MTVqsdC9W
public\_key(AACR17iKCZrb1JqSjUncCbDGQenzSqyuNmPU8iUA15efNW5KD1iHd9x)
\end{DoxyCode}
 Indeed, the public key recovered from this digest and signature matches the public key from the key stored in the Secure Enclave.
