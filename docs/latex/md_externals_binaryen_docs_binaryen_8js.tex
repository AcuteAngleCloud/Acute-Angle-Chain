\subsection*{Overview }

binaryen.\+js is a port of Binaryen to the Web, allowing you to generate Web\+Assembly using a Java\+Script A\+PI. To get a feel for the A\+PI, see the \char`\"{}hello world\char`\"{} test at {\ttfamily test/binaryen.\+js/hello-\/world.js}, and other tests in that directory for more examples.

The A\+PI is documented in the rest of this document.

\subsection*{Types }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+none}\+: The none type.
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+i32}\+: The i32 type.
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+i64}\+: The i64 type.
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+f32}\+: The f32 type.
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+f64}\+: The f64 type.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Modules }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Binaryen.\+Module()}\+: Constructor for a Binaryen Web\+Assembly module. You need to create one of these first.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily Module} instances have the following properties.

Module property operations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily add\+Function\+Type(name, result\+Type, param\+Types)}\+: Add a function type to the module, with a specified name, result type, and param types.
\item {\ttfamily add\+Function(name, function\+Type, var\+Types, body)}\+: Add a function, with a name, a function type, an array of local types, and a body.
\item {\ttfamily add\+Import(internal\+Name, external\+Module\+Name, external\+Base\+Name, function\+Type)}\+: Add an import, with an internal name (used by other things in the module), an external module name (the module from which we import), an external base name (the name we import from that module), and a function type (for function imports).
\item {\ttfamily add\+Export(internal\+Name, external\+Name)}\+: Add an export, with an internal name and an external name (the name the outside sees it exported as).
\item {\ttfamily set\+Function\+Table(funcs)}\+: Sets the function table to a array of functions.
\item {\ttfamily set\+Memory(initial, maximum, export\+Name, segments)}\+: Sets the memory to having an initial size, maximum size, optional export name, and array of data segments.
\item {\ttfamily set\+Start(start)}\+: Sets the start function (called when the module is instantiated) to a specified function.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Module operations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily emit\+Binary()}\+: Returns a binary for the module, which you can then compile and run in the browser.
\item {\ttfamily emit\+Text()}\+: Returns a text representation of the module, in s-\/expression format.
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{authority_8hpp_a98696231ed7d6f1c166797053cebc5eb}{validate()}}}\+: Validates the module, checking it for correctness.
\item {\ttfamily optimize()}\+: Optimize the module.
\item {\ttfamily auto\+Drop()}\+: Automatically inserts {\ttfamily drop} operations. This lets you not worry about dropping when creating your code.
\item {\ttfamily interpret()}\+: Run the module in the Binaryen interpreter (creates the module, and calls the start method). Useful for debugging.
\item {\ttfamily dispose()}\+: Cleans up the module. If the Binaryen object can be garbage-\/collected anyhow, you don\textquotesingle{}t need to do this, but if it stays around -\/ e.\+g. if you create multiple {\ttfamily Module}s over time -\/ then you should call this once a {\ttfamily Module} is no longer needed. (As binaryen.\+js uses compiled C++ code, we can\textquotesingle{}t just rely on normal garbage collection to clean things up internally.)

Relooper instances have the following methods\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily add\+Block(code)}\+: Adds a new block to the C\+FG, containing the provided code (expression) as its body.
\item {\ttfamily add\+Branch(from, to, condition, code)}\+: Adds a branch from a block to another block, with a condition (or nothing, if this is the default branch to take from the origin -\/ each block must have one such branch), and optional code to execute on the branch (useful for phis).
\item {\ttfamily add\+Block\+With\+Switch(code, condition)}\+: Adds a new block, which ends with a switch/br\+\_\+table, with provided code and condition (that determines where we go in the switch).
\item {\ttfamily add\+Branch\+For\+Switch(from, to, indexes, code)}\+: Adds a branch from a block ending in a switch, to another block, using an array of indexes that determine where to go, and optional code to execute on the branch.
\item {\ttfamily render\+And\+Dispose(entry, label\+Helper, module)}\+: Renders and cleans up the Relooper instance. Call this after you have created all the blocks and branches, giving it the entry block (where control flow begins), a label helper variable (an index of a local we can use, necessary for irreducible control flow), and the module. This returns an expression -\/ normal Web\+Assembly code -\/ that you can use normally anywhere.
