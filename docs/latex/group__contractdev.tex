\subsection{Detailed Description}
Introduction to writing contracts for A\+A\+C.\+IO. 

\hypertarget{group__contractdev_background}{}\subsection{Background}\label{group__contractdev_background}
A\+A\+C.\+IO contracts (aka applications) are deployed to a blockchain as pre-\/compiled Web Assembly (aka W\+A\+SM). W\+A\+SM is compiled from C/\+C++ using L\+L\+VM and clang, which means that you will require knowledge of C/\+C++ in order to develop your blockchain applications. While it is possible to develop in \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_c}{C}}, we strongly recommend that all developers use the A\+A\+C.\+IO C++ A\+PI which provides much stronger type safety and is generally easier to read.\hypertarget{group__contractdev_programstructure}{}\subsection{Application Structure}\label{group__contractdev_programstructure}
A\+A\+C.\+IO applications are designed around event (aka action) handlers that respond to user actions. For example, a user might transfer tokens to another user. This event can be processed and potentially rejected by the sender, the receiver, and the currency application itself.

As an application developer you get to decide what actions users can take and which handlers may or must be called in response to those events.\hypertarget{group__contractdev_programentry}{}\subsubsection{Entry Points}\label{group__contractdev_programentry}
A\+A\+C.\+IO applications have a {\ttfamily apply} which is like {\ttfamily main} in traditional applications\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{extern} \textcolor{stringliteral}{"C"} \{
   \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} init();
   \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} \mbox{\hyperlink{aacio_8system_8cpp_abdb22838286244938c6192c2a2263d9c}{apply}}( uint64\_t code, uint64\_t \mbox{\hyperlink{structaction}{action}} );
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily apply} is given the arguments {\ttfamily code} and {\ttfamily action} which uniquely identify every event in the system. For example, {\ttfamily code} could be a {\itshape currency} contract and {\ttfamily action} could be {\itshape transfer}. This event (code,action) may be passed to several contracts including the {\ttfamily sender} and {\ttfamily receiver}. It is up to your application to figure out what to do in response to such an event.

{\ttfamily init} is another entry point that is called once immediately after loading the code. It is where you should perform one-\/time initialization of state.

\paragraph*{Example Apply Entry Handler}

Generally speaking, you should use your entry handler to dispatch events to functions that implement the majority of your logic and optionally reject events that your contract is unable or unwilling to accept.


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{extern} \textcolor{stringliteral}{"C"} \{
   \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} \mbox{\hyperlink{aacio_8system_8cpp_abdb22838286244938c6192c2a2263d9c}{apply}}( uint64\_t code, uint64\_t \mbox{\hyperlink{structaction}{action}} ) \{
      \textcolor{keywordflow}{if}( code == \mbox{\hyperlink{group__types_gaf9c1edb0e0da55ec6ba09f32f6839529}{N}}(currency) ) \{
         \textcolor{keywordflow}{if}( \mbox{\hyperlink{structaction}{action}} == \mbox{\hyperlink{group__types_gaf9c1edb0e0da55ec6ba09f32f6839529}{N}}(\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacetransfer}{transfer}}) ) 
            currency::apply\_currency\_transfer( current\_action< currency::transfer >() );
      \} \textcolor{keywordflow}{else} \{
         \mbox{\hyperlink{group__systemcapi_gaf5c36ddbe4ddd977456ac9aefcdb923f}{aacio\_assert}}( \textcolor{keyword}{false}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"rejecting unexpected event"} );
      \}
   \}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
When defining your entry points it is required that they are placed in an {\ttfamily extern \char`\"{}\+C\char`\"{}} code block so that c++ name mangling does not get applied to the function. 
\end{DoxyNote}
