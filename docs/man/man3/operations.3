.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBA\fP set of valid comands for mutating the globally shared state\&. 

An operation can be thought of like a function that will modify the global shared state of the blockchain\&. The members of each struct are like function arguments and each operation can potentially generate a return value\&.
.PP
Operations can be grouped into transactions (\fBtransaction\fP) to ensure that they occur in a particular order and that all operations apply successfully or no operations apply\&.
.PP
Each operation is a fully defined state transition and can exist in a transaction on its own\&.
.SH "Design Principles"
.PP
Operations have been carefully designed to include all of the information necessary to interpret them outside the context of the blockchain\&. This means that information about current chain state is included in the operation even though it could be inferred from a subset of the data\&. This makes the expected outcome of each operation well defined and easily understood without access to chain state\&.
.SS "Balance Calculation Principle"
We have stipulated that the current account balance may be entirely calculated from just the subset of operations that are relevant to that account\&. There should be no need to process the entire blockchain inorder to know your account's balance\&.
.SS "Explicit Fee Principle"
Blockchain fees can change from time to time and it is important that a signed transaction explicitly agree to the fees it will be paying\&. This aids with account balance updates and ensures that the sender agreed to the fee prior to making the transaction\&.
.SS "Explicit Authority"
Each operation shall contain enough information to know which accounts must authorize the operation\&. This principle enables authority verification to occur in a centralized, optimized, and parallel manner\&.
.SS "Explicit Relevant Accounts"
Each operation contains enough information to enumerate all accounts for which the operation should apear in its account history\&. This principle enables us to easily define and enforce the \&. This is superset of the \fBExplicit Authority\fP
