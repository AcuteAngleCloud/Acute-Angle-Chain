C++14 [func\&.def] 20\&.9\&.0 (1) The following definitions apply to this Clause: (2) \fBA\fP call signature is the name of a return type followed by a parenthesized comma-separated list of zero or more argument types\&. (3) \fBA\fP callable type is a function object type (20\&.9) or a pointer to member\&. (4) \fBA\fP callable object is an object of a callable type\&. (5) \fBA\fP call wrapper type is a type that holds a callable object and supports a call operation that forwards to that object\&. (6) \fBA\fP call wrapper is an object of a call wrapper type\&. (7) \fBA\fP target object is the callable object held by a call wrapper\&. C++14 [func\&.require] 20\&.9\&.1

Define INVOKE (f, t1, t2, \&.\&.\&., tN) as follows: (1\&.1) - (t1\&.*f)(t2, \&.\&.\&., tN) when f is a pointer to a member function of a class \fBT\fP and t1 is an object of type \fBT\fP or a reference to an object of type \fBT\fP or a reference to an object of a type derived from \fBT\fP; (1\&.2) - ((*t1)\&.*f)(t2, \&.\&.\&., tN) when f is a pointer to a member function of a class \fBT\fP and t1 is not one of the types described in the previous item; (1\&.3) - t1\&.*f when N == 1 and f is a pointer to member data of a class \fBT\fP and t1 is an object of type \fBT\fP or a reference to an object of type \fBT\fP or a reference to an object of a type derived from \fBT\fP; (1\&.4) - (*t1)\&.*f when N == 1 and f is a pointer to member data of a class \fBT\fP and t1 is not one of the types described in the previous item; (1\&.5) - f(t1, t2, \&.\&.\&., tN) in all other cases\&.
