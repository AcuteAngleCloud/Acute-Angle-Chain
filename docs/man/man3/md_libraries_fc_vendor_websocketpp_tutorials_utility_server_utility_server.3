.SS "Step 1"
.PP
\fIAdd WebSocket++ includes and set up a a server endpoint type\&.\fP
.PP
WebSocket++ includes two major object types\&. The endpoint and the connection\&. The endpoint creates and launches new connections and maintains default settings for those connections\&. Endpoints also manage any shared network resources\&.
.PP
The connection stores information specific to each WebSocket session\&.
.PP
.RS 4
\fBNote:\fP Once a connection is launched, there is no link between the endpoint and the connection\&. All default settings are copied into the new connection by the endpoint\&. Changing default settings on an endpoint will only affect future connections\&. 
.RE
.PP
Connections do not maintain a link back to their associated endpoint\&. Endpoints do not maintain a list of outstanding connections\&. If your application needs to iterate over all connections it will need to maintain a list of them itself\&.
.PP
WebSocket++ endpoints are built by combining an endpoint role with an endpoint config\&. There are two different types of endpoint roles, one each for the client and server roles in a WebSocket session\&. This is a server tutorial so we will use the server role \fC\fBwebsocketpp::server\fP\fP which is provided by the \fC<\fBwebsocketpp/server\&.hpp\fP>\fP header\&.
.PP
.RS 4
.SS "Terminology: Endpoint Config"
.PP
WebSocket++ endpoints have a group of settings that may be configured at compile time via the \fCconfig\fP template parameter\&. \fBA\fP config is a struct that contains types and static constants that are used to produce an endpoint with specific properties\&. Depending on which config is being used the endpoint will have different methods available and may have additional third party dependencies\&. 
.RE
.PP
.PP
The endpoint role takes a template parameter called \fCconfig\fP that is used to configure the behavior of endpoint at compile time\&. For this example we are going to use a default config provided by the library called \fCasio\fP, provided by \fC<\fBwebsocketpp/config/asio_no_tls\&.hpp\fP>\fP\&. This is a server config that uses the Asio library to provide network transport and does not support TLS based security\&. Later on we will discuss how to introduce TLS based security into a WebSocket++ application, more about the other stock configs, and how to build your own custom configs\&.
.PP
Combine a config with an endpoint role to produce a fully configured endpoint\&. This type will be used frequently so I would recommend a typedef here\&.
.PP
\fCtypedef \fBwebsocketpp::server\fP<\fBwebsocketpp::config::asio\fP> server\fP
.PP
.SS "\fC\fButility_server\fP\fP constructor"
.PP
This endpoint type will be the base of the \fButility_server\fP object that will keep track of the state of the server\&. Within the \fC\fButility_server\fP\fP constructor several things happen:
.PP
First, we adjust the endpoint logging behavior to include all error logging channels and all access logging channels except the frame payload, which is particularly noisy and generally useful only for debugging\&. [TODO: link to more information about logging]
.PP
.PP
.nf
m_endpoint\&.set_error_channels(websocketpp::log::elevel::all);
m_endpoint\&.set_access_channels(websocketpp::log::alevel::all ^ websocketpp::log::alevel::frame_payload);
.fi
.PP
.PP
Next, we initialize the transport system underlying the endpoint\&. This method is specific to the Asio transport not WebSocket++ core\&. It will not be necessary or present in endpoints that use a non-asio config\&.
.PP
.RS 4
\fBNote:\fP This example uses an internal Asio \fCio_service\fP that is managed by the endpoint itself\&. This is a simple arrangement suitable for programs where WebSocket++ is the only code using Asio\&. If you have an existing program that already manages an \fCio_service\fP object or want to build a new program where WebSocket++ handlers share an io_service with other handlers you can pass the \fCio_service\fP you want WebSocket++ to register its handlers on to the \fCinit_asio()\fP method and it will use it instead of generating and managing its own\&. [TODO: FAQ link instead?] 
.RE

.nf
m_endpoint\&.init_asio();
.fi
.PP
.PP
.SS "\fCutility_server::run\fP method"
.PP
In addition to the constructor, we also add a run method that sets up the listening socket, begins accepting connections, starts the Asio io_service event loop\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
// Listen on port 9002
m_endpoint\&.listen(9002);

// Queues a connection accept operation
m_endpoint\&.start_accept();

// Start the Asio io_service run loop
m_endpoint\&.run();
.fi
.PP
.PP
The final line, \fCm_endpoint\&.run();\fP, will block until the endpoint is instructed to stop listening for new connections\&. While running it will listen for and process new connections as well as accept and process new data and control messages for existing connections\&. WebSocket++ uses Asio in an asyncronous mode where multiple connections can be similtaneously serviced efficiently within a single thread\&.
.PP
.SS "Build"
.PP
Adding WebSocket++ has added a few dependencies to our program that must be addressed in the build system\&. Firstly, the WebSocket++ library headers need must be in the include search path of your build system\&. How exactly this is done depends on where you have the WebSocket++ headers installed what build system you are using\&.
.PP
For the rest of this tutorial we are going to assume a C++11 build environment\&. WebSocket++ will work with pre-C++11 systems if your build system has access to a recent version of the Boost library headers\&.
.PP
Finally, to use the Asio transport config we need to bring in the Asio library\&. There are two options here\&. If you have access to a C++11 build environment the standalone version from http://think-async.com is a good option\&. This header only library does not bring in any special dependencies and ensures you have the latest version of Asio\&. If you do not have a C++11 build environment or already have brought in the Boost libraries you can also use the version of Asio bundled with Boost\&.
.PP
To use standalone Asio, make sure the Asio headers are in your include path and define ASIO_STANDALONE\&. To use Boost Asio, make sure the Boost headers are in your include path and that you are linking to the boost_system library\&.
.PP
\fCc++ -std=c++11 step1\&.cpp\fP (Asio Standalone) OR \fCc++ -std=c++11 step1\&.cpp -lboost_system\fP (Boost Asio)

#### Code so far

         // Set logging settings
        m_endpoint\&.set_error_channels(websocketpp::log::elevel::all);
        m_endpoint\&.set_access_channels(websocketpp::log::alevel::all ^ websocketpp::log::alevel::frame_payload);

        // Initialize Asio
        m_endpoint\&.init_asio();
    }

    void run() {
        // Listen on port 9002
        m_endpoint\&.listen(9002);

        // Queues a connection accept operation
        m_endpoint\&.start_accept();

        // Start the Asio io_service run loop
        m_endpoint\&.run();
    }

    server m_endpoint;

.SS "Terminology: Registering handlers"
.PP
WebSocket++ provides a number of execution points where you can register to have a handler run\&. Which of these points are available to your endpoint will depend on its config\&. TLS handlers will not exist on non-TLS endpoints for example\&. \fBA\fP complete list of handlers can be found at http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp/manual/reference/handler-list\&.
.PP
Handlers can be registered at the endpoint level and at the connection level\&. Endpoint handlers are copied into new connections as they are created\&. Changing an endpoint handler will affect only future connections\&. Handlers registered at the connection level will be bound to that specific connection only\&.
.PP
The signature of handler binding methods is the same for endpoints and connections\&. The format is: \fCset_*_handler(\&.\&.\&.)\fP\&. Where * is the name of the handler\&. For example, \fCset_open_handler(\&.\&.\&.)\fP will set the handler to be called when a new connection is open\&. \fCset_fail_handler(\&.\&.\&.)\fP will set the handler to be called when a connection fails to connect\&.
.PP
All handlers take one argument, a callable type that can be converted to a \fCstd::function\fP with the correct count and type of arguments\&. You can pass free functions, functors, and Lambdas with matching argument lists as handlers\&. In addition, you can use \fCstd::bind\fP (or \fCboost::bind\fP) to register functions with non-matching argument lists\&. This is useful for passing additional parameters not present in the handler signature or member functions that need to carry a 'this' pointer\&.
.PP
The function signature of each handler can be looked up in the list above in the manual\&. In general, all handlers include the \fCconnection_hdl\fP identifying which connection this even is associated with as the first parameter\&. Some handlers (such as the message handler) include additional parameters\&. Most handlers have a void return value but some (\fCvalidate\fP, \fCping\fP, \fCtls_init\fP) do not\&. The specific meanings of the return values are documented in the handler list linked above\&.
