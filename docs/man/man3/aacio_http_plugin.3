.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This plugin starts an HTTP server and dispatches queries to registered handles based upon URL\&. The handler is passed the URL that was requested and a callback method that should be called with the response code and body\&.
.PP
The handler will be called from the appbase application io_service thread\&. The callback can be called from any thread and will automatically propagate the call to the http thread\&.
.PP
The HTTP service will run in its own thread with its own io_service to make sure that HTTP request processing does not interfer with other plugins\&.
