.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBtester_network\fP class provides a simplistic virtual P2P network connecting testing_blockchains together\&. 

\fBA\fP tester may be connected to zero or more tester_networks at any given time\&. When a new tester joins the network, it will be synced with all other blockchains already in the network (blocks known only to the new chain will be pushed to the prior network members and vice versa, ignoring blocks not on the main fork)\&. After this, whenever any blockchain in the network gets a new block, that block will be pushed to all other blockchains in the network as well\&.
