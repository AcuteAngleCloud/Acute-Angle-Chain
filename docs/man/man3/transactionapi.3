.PP 
Define API for sending transactions and inline messages\&. 

\fBA\fP AAC\&.IO transaction has the following abstract structure:
.PP
.PP
.nf
struct transaction {
  Name scope[]; 
  Name readScope[]; 
  message messages[]; 
};
.fi
.PP
.PP
This API enables your contract to construct and send transactions
.PP
Deferred transactions will not be processed until a future block\&. They can therefore have no effect on the success of failure of their parent transaction so long as they appear well formed\&. If any other condition causes the parent transaction to be marked as failing, then the deferred transaction will never be processed\&.
.PP
Deferred transactions must adhere to the permissions available to the parent transaction or, in the future, delegated to the contract account for future use\&.
.PP
An inline message allows one contract to send another contract a message which is processed immediately after the current message's processing ends such that the success or failure of the parent transaction is dependent on the success of the message\&. If an inline message fails in processing then the whole tree of transactions and messages rooted in the block will me marked as failing and none of effects on the database will persist\&.
.PP
Because of this and the parallel nature of transaction application, inline messages may not affect any \fCscope\fP which is not listed in their parent transaction's \fCscope\fP\&. They also may not read any \fCscope\fP not listed in either their parent transaction's \fCscope\fP or \fCreadScope\fP\&.
.PP
Inline messages and Deferred transactions must adhere to the permissions available to the parent transaction or, in the future, delegated to the contract account for future use\&.
